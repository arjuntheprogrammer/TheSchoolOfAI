## **Phase 2 Session 10: Assignment**

### THE ENDGAME PROJECT
1. Refer to the code shared in Assignment 7.
2. Now use the same environment (car/map/sand/etc), and move that to TD3
3. Record your best attempt (it will be evaluated on how good your car's driving was in this video)
4. Upload Video on YouTube, upload your code to GitHub along with Google-Colab code for A7Car+TD3.
5. Copy the Video and Code link to this assignment.
6. Done!


### EXPECTATION
1. You are indeed using TD3
2. You are NOT using SENSORS
3. You are using Conv Network (very very simple one) on your sand (so you can use MNIST type too) to get the sensory data.
4. You have understood the problem and actually have tried to solve this problem.

> * Take the Car environment we had created and run T3D on top of it.
> * This time you don't have sensors, but have to write a code to crop an image out of the map, and then learn from it.
> * It is going to be a very complicated exercise. You will have only 2 weeks to finish it.
> * So make 1000% sure you understand the code shared here as this is going to be the backend for that exercise.
